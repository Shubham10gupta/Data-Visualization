# Data-Visualization
Developed a comprehensive data visualization project for the Iris dataset using Python’s Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
The project includes various plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to explore the relationships between features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Additionally, the visualizations highlight the distinct species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor.
Interactive plots are implemented using Plotly for enhanced user engagement, allowing users to dynamically filter and explore the data. The goal is to provide clear, insightful visual representations that aid in understanding the underlying patterns and characteristics of the Iris dataset.
